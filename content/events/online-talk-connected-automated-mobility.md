The IEEE Student Branch of International Hellenic University (Thessaloniki) is very glad to invite you to the 6th webinar of our initiative IEEEIHUThess goes online! The webinar is co-organized by the IEEE Communication Chapter and the Professional Activities of the IEEE Greece Section!

- Wednesday 27th May 2020
- 18:00-19:00 EEST
- Robert Piechocki, Professor at University of Bristol

**Abstract**:
We are on the cusp of the biggest revolution on our roads since the advent of the internal combustion engine. Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) promises to deliver safe, efficient, inclusive and environmentally responsible transportation services. However future smart vehicles will require smart infrastructure to fulfil all the promised potentials. Road side sensing (via lidar, radar, video etc.) will enhance road safety; virtual and dynamic signage and regulations communicated wirelessly will orchestrate traffic flow and resolve contention at intersections. In this lecture Robert attempts to shed some light on what the future connected infrastructure for automated vehicles might look.

**Short bio**:
Robert Piechocki is a Professor in the School of Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering and Engineering Maths, University of Bristol. He is also a Fellow at The Alan Turing Institute (UK national institute for data sciences and AI). His research interests span the areas of Connected Intelligent Systems, Wireless Networks, Information and Communication Theory, Statistics and Machine Learning. His domain expertise is Connected and Automated Mobility (CAM) and wireless sensing for eHealth. In his research work he strives to develop solutions for decision making and inference in networked systems which communicate over resource constrained and unreliable links. Example of such networks are fleets of CAMs, which demand ultra-reliable and low-latency connectivity, despite very rapid changes in network topology and severe interference. Additional interests include contextual sensing in energy constraint IoT systems, such as battery powered IoT systems in residential healthcare applications. Rob has published over 200 papers in peer-reviewed international journals and conferences and holds 13 patents in these areas. Rob leads wireless connectivity and sensing research activities for the IRC SPHERE project (winner of 2016 World Technology Award) and leads several current high-profile projects in networks, AI, connectivity and sensing funded by industry, Innovate UK and EPSRC such as NG-CDI, OPERA, FLOURISH, CAVShield
