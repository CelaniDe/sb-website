title: IEEEXtreme 2020 Competition
description: "IEEEXtreme is a global challenge in which teams of IEEE Student members compete in a 24-hour time span against each other to solve a set of programming problems. As always, our Student Branch had many members form teams and enter the competition. Although virtually, and not in the Sindos Campus due to the special circumstances of this year, we competed and had an amazing experience."
